This Python script is designed to count the occurrence of the nucleotides 'A', 'T', 'G' and 'C' in a DNA sequence contained in a text file.

## Usage
The script accepts a single argument, the name of the file to read:

```
python3 count_atgc.py [file]
```

## Output

## Error control

If the provided file does not exist, the script will generate an error message.

## Tests

This script can be tested by running it from the command line by entering a file with a DNA sequence with a known occurrence for each nucleotide.

```
python3 count_atgc.py [file]
```

## Data
